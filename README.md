# Estimate distance from the camera for detected faces.
*Tensorflow Object Detection is used to detect and track human faces in live feed.*
# Objective
The main objective to create this project is to provide an alert to those who use electronic devices such as smartphones and laptops so close to their eyes.Usage of such devices so close to the eyes affects the eyesight. This module monitors the distance and provides an alert if the eye-device-contact is closer.
 
 # Note
 Adjust the focal length in *utils/detector_utils.py*, for better results.

## Installation
*Requirements:*

1.Opencv

2.Numpy

3.imutils

4.Tensorflow

5.Python 3.6


After installing the required packages, run **main.py**.
