# Estimate distance from the camera for detected faces.
*Tensorflow Object Detection is used to detect and track human faces in live feed.*

 Adjust the focal length in *utils/detector_utils.py*, for better results.

## Installation
*Requirements:*

1.Opencv

2.Numpy

3.imutils

4.Tensorflow

5.Python 3.6


After installing the required packages, run **main.py**.
